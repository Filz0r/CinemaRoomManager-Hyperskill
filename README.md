# üé¨ Welcome to the Cinema Room Manager üé¨

## Project Overview

This Java application simulates a basic cinema room management system. It allows users to:

*   **Visualize the seating arrangement:** See which seats are available and which have been purchased.
*   **Purchase tickets:** Choose a specific row and seat to reserve.
*   **View statistics:** Get insights into ticket sales, occupancy, current income, and total potential income.

It's a perfect starting point for understanding console-based interactive applications and working with 2D arrays.

## Features

*   **Interactive Menu:** A user-friendly text-based menu guides users through the application.
*   **Seat Selection:** Allows users to buy tickets for specific row and seat combinations.
*   **Seat Visualization:** The seating arrangement is displayed with 'S' for available seats and 'B' for booked seats.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Ticket prices vary based on the number of seats in the theater. If the cinema is 60 seats or less, the price will be $10. If not, the price will be $10 for seats in the first half and $8 for seats in the second half.
*   **Statistics:** Displays the number of purchased tickets, percentage of seats occupied, current revenue and total potential revenue.
*   **Robust Input Handling:** Ensures the application doesn't crash due to invalid user input.
